This is refresh-updatesd, a plugin for Yum.

refresh-updatesd tells yum-updatesd to check for updates when yum exits.
This way, if you run 'yum list updates' and yum says there's a new version
of zsh available, puplet will almost instantly update itself to reflect this.

The plugin is very dumb, It should probably only send the message in
certain cases.
